## 💎 The Vision
The current financial infrastructure is a relic of the pre-quantum, pre-AI era. It is slow, fragmented, and vulnerable to the impending "Quantum Apocalypse." QuantCoin is not just another blockchain; it is the **Sovereign Quantum Operating System** for the next thousand years of human and machine cooperation.

We are building a future where 1 Trillion transactions occur every second with zero friction, zero central authority, and absolute resistance to any computational threat—classical or quantum.

## 🚀 Technical Supremacy: The 1 Trillion TPS Engine

QuantCoin solves the **Scalability Trilemma** once and for all through an architecture that scales horizontally with the speed of global light-speed networking.

### 1. Hyper-Sharded DAG-BFT Topology
Instead of a single bottlenecked chain, QuantCoin utilizes a multi-dimensional **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** layered with an asynchronous **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)** gadget.
- **State Partitioning**: The global ledger is divided into $2^{20}$ (1,048,576) autonomous shards.
- **Concurrent Execution**: Transactions are ordered via **Concurrent Kahn’s Algorithm**, allowing thousands of CPU cores to validate the same shard simultaneously without mutex-locks.
- **Sub-Second Finality**: We achieve deterministic finality in <500ms through **Logarithmic Cross-Shard Routing**.

### 2. Post-Quantum Sovereignty (Lattice-Based)
QuantCoin is cryptographically indestructible. We have discarded all legacy ECDSA/RSA primitives in favor of NIST Level 5 Lattice-based algorithms.
- **Digital Signatures**: **ML-DSA-87 (Dilithium-5)**. Absolute resistance to forgery by Shor's algorithm.
- **Key Exchange**: **ML-KEM-1024 (Kyber-1024)**. Every P2P node connection is a quantum-resistant tunnel.
- **Address Sovereignty**: QCv1 addresses are derived via high-entropy, memory-hard hashing, ensuring even initial wallet creation is quantum-safe.

## 🔋 Evolutionary Mining: Transitioning the Species

QuantCoin introduces **Evolutionary Mining**, a protocol that adapts as computation evolves from classical silicon to quantum qubits.

### Phase A: Classical Proof-of-Work (Argon2id)
Distributed fairly using memory-hard Argon2id. No ASIC domination. Accessible to every human with a computer.

### Phase B: Proof of Quantumness (PoQ)
As quantum computers emerge, the protocol activates **Boson Sampling Challenges**. 
- **Quantum Fidelity**: Mining yield is directly tied to the physical fidelity of a verified quantum device.
- **The Cap**: To prevent a "Quantum Hash War," each verified quantum footprint is strictly capped at **0.5 QC / 24 hours**.

## ⚖️ Economic Sovereignty: The 22 Trillion Law

QuantCoin's economy is governed by mathematical laws, not political whims.

- **Hard Cap**: 22,000,000,000,000 QC (22 Trillion).
- **Founder Treasury**: 5% of the total supply is held in a **7-of-11 Threshold Multi-Sig DAO**. This treasury is locked by on-chain code, not private keys, and vests linearly over 10 years.
- **Anti-Whale Stagnation Tax**: To prevent institutional hoarding, any non-founder cluster holding >0.5% of the supply incurs a **0.5% annual stagnation tax**. This tax is automatically burned or redistributed to active staking nodes.
- **Hyper-Micro Fees**: Base fee is fixed at **0.0000001 QC**. We target $0.01 USD equivalent, forever.

## 📡 Off-Grid & Interstellar Ready
QuantCoin is designed to survive partial or total internet collapse.
- **LoRaWAN Mesh**: Propagate transactions via low-power radio over hundreds of miles.
- **Satellite Relays**: Dual-way block synchronization via LEO satellite constellations.
- **Store-and-Forward**: Transactions can be signed offline and queued; they automatically resolve upon the next connection to any broadcasting node.

## 🛠️ Implementation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the Sovereign Ledger
git clone https://github.com/nayrbryanGaming/QUANTCOIN.git

# Initialize the Core Engine (Rust 1.75+)
cargo build --release

# Launch a Validator Node
./target/release/quantcoin-core --mode validator
```

### 📦 Dependencies
- `libp2p`: PQC-tunneled peer-to-peer networking.
- `halo2`: Recursive ZK-SNARKs for shard state compression.
- `rocksdb`: High-velocity persistent state storage.
- `pqcrypto`: Optimized lattice-based primitives.

## 🏛️ Governance
QuantCoin operates as a **Quadratic Representative DAO**. Voting power is the square root of your stake ($\sqrt{QC}$), ensuring that the many always outweigh the few.
